# Netflix-clone


This project is a basic clone of the Netflix landing page layout using HTML and CSS. It focuses on replicating the visual structure and doesn't include any functionality.

What's included:

Basic HTML structure for the Netflix landing page.
CSS styles to achieve the layout and visual design.
Images (replace with placeholders if needed).
What's not included:

JavaScript functionality (sign-in, search, recommendations, etc.).
Responsive design (adapting for different screen sizes).
Database connection or user interaction.
Getting Started:

Download the files (index.html and style.css).
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Customization:

Feel free to modify the HTML and CSS to customize the layout and design to your liking.
Replace placeholder images with your own.


This is a basic project to practice HTML and CSS. A real-world Netflix clone would require additional technologies like JavaScript and backend development.
